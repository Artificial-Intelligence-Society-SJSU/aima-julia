    "A very useful application of text model is categorizing text into a language. In fact, with enough data we can categorize correctly mostly any text. That is because different languages have certain characteristics that set them apart. For example, in German it is very usual for 'c' to be followed by 'h' while in English we see 't' followed by 'h' a lot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we get the text model for the sentence, we need to unravel it. The text models show the probability of each bigram, but the classifier can't handle that extra data. It requires a simple *list* of bigrams. So, if the text model shows that a bigram appears three times, we need to add it three times in the list. Since the text model stores the n-gram information in a dictionary (with the key being the n-gram and the value the number of times the n-gram appears) we need to iterate through the items of the dictionary and manually add them to the list of n-grams."

    "You can add more languages if you want, the algorithm works for as many as you like! Also, you can play around with *n*. Here we used 2, but other numbers work too (even though 2 suffices). The algorithm is not perfect, but it has high accuracy even for small samples like the ones we used. That is because English and German are very different languages. The closer together languages are (for example, Norwegian and Swedish share a lot of common ground) the lower the accuracy of the classifier."
